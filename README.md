# rotatedFrames
A little program that rotates pieces of a mandala at different speeds, eventually will procedurally generate mandalas

This program is a personal project that I am working on.  The eventual idea is to procedurally generate
colored mandala layers that spin at different speeds as you zoom in, more layers being created as others leave
the screen.  The idea is to eventually use it as a cool music visualizer.


So far (4/21/19) I have a simple gui that loads up to 8 layers of a mandala with several different rotation
algorithms (simple clockwise/counterclockwise, sine function, square root function, various exponential functions).
I'll be using this file to keep track of major milestones in the project

4/21/19 example:  A 4-layer mandala that rotates with basic linear clockwise and counterclockwise algorithms
